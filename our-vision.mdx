## Our vision

OrbitCurve’s vision is to become **the security data layer for AI**, the default way that serious AI systems are trained and evaluated on realistic security signals. Our mission is to ensure that Large Language Models and AI Agents are cybersecurity capable, enabling enterprises to build AI solutions on accurate and robust cybersecurity context. Positioning us at the infrastructure layer of any cybersecurity based AI solution.

We believe:

- Future AI systems will be deeply entangled with critical infrastructure, security tooling, and offensive/defensive operations.
- High quality, security focused data will be as important as model architecture for keeping those systems safe.
- Security researchers and ML teams need a shared, purpose‑built data foundation to work effectively together.

## What success looks like

In the long run, success means:

- Every frontier and enterprise model is **trained, fine tuned, and evaluated** on strong security datasets.
- Red teaming and security evaluations are **continuous, data driven, and standardized**.
- Organizations can contribute and benefit from a **privacy preserving security data network**, rather than working in isolated silos.

This docs section will evolve as our roadmap and products expand, but the core goal stays the same: **make AI safer by making security data first class.**
