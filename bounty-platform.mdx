## OrbitCurve bounty platform

The bounty platform is how **security researchers and practitioners collaborate with OrbitCurve** to improve our datasets, benchmarks, and evaluations.

Our goals:

- Reward high‑quality security research that translates into **better training and evaluation data**.  
- Continuously expand coverage of attack surfaces, techniques, and defensive behaviors.  
- Create a structured way for experts to contribute without needing to manage ML infrastructure themselves.

## Types of bounties

Examples of bounty categories we plan to support:

- **Scenario & prompt design** – realistic attacker/defender interactions, red‑team scenarios, and abuse attempts.  
- **Labeling & annotation** – expert labels for model outputs, vulnerabilities, or security‑critical decisions.  
- **Benchmark proposals** – new tasks or metrics that stress‑test specific security properties of models.

## Participation (early stage)

We’re still in the early stages of the bounty platform. If you’re interested in participating:

- Follow us on X at `https://x.com/OrbitCurveSec`.  
- Connect via LinkedIn at `https://www.linkedin.com/company/orbitcurve/`.  
- Reach out through our website at `https://orbitcurve.com`.

As the platform launches, this page will be updated with **formal rules, payout structures, and submission workflows**.
