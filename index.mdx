## 1. What is OrbitCurve?

OrbitCurve is a cybersecurity data company focused on **high‑quality, unique security context and post‑training datasets for LLMs**.  
We serve frontier model labs and enterprises that need **realistic, up‑to‑date, and safety‑aware security data** to train, fine‑tune, and evaluate AI systems.

Our work sits at the intersection of **AI, cybersecurity, and security research**, with a focus on:

- Curating and synthesizing security‑relevant data that reflects real‑world attacker and defender behavior
- Structuring that data so it is directly useful for **LLM training, fine‑tuning, evaluation, and red‑teaming**
- Helping customers ship AI systems that are **more secure, more robust, and harder to abuse**

## 2. What does the OrbitCurve platform do?

The OrbitCurve platform is designed to give AI teams a **single place to work with security‑focused data at scale**. At a high level, the platform will provide:

- **Curated datasets**
  - Frontier‑model‑ready datasets tailored to security use cases (offense, defense, detection, abuse‑resistance)
  - Cleaned, deduplicated, and labeled to be immediately usable in training pipelines

- **Post‑training and evaluation tooling**
  - Interfaces and APIs to plug our datasets into your fine‑tuning and evaluation workflows
  - Benchmarks that focus on **security‑relevant capabilities, failure modes, and safety properties**

- **Security research workflows**
  - Support for red‑teaming, scenario generation, and stress‑testing models on realistic adversarial behavior
  - Collaboration features for security researchers and ML engineers working together

As the platform evolves, this docs site will contain:

- Product and API reference for integrating OrbitCurve into your stack
- Guides for using our datasets in training and evaluation pipelines
- Best practices for building safer, more robust AI systems with security‑aware data

## 3. Vision and timeline

OrbitCurve’s long‑term vision is to become **the security data layer for AI**, so that every serious AI system is trained and evaluated on strong, realistic security signals.

In practical terms, our roadmap looks like this:

1. **Phase 1 – Datasets (near‑term)**  
   - Ship initial frontier‑model‑ready cybersecurity datasets for select customers  
   - Iterate quickly with early partners to refine coverage, labeling, and evaluation metrics

2. **Phase 2 – Platform & workflows (short‑ to mid‑term)**  
   - Launch the first version of the OrbitCurve platform for dataset access, evaluation, and integration  
   - Provide APIs, SDKs, and templates for plugging our data into training and red‑teaming workflows

3. **Phase 3 – Security data network (long‑term)**  
   - Grow a rich ecosystem of continuously updated security data sources and benchmarks  
   - Enable organizations to contribute and benefit from shared, privacy‑preserving security intelligence  
   - Become a default component of how frontier and enterprise models are trained and validated for security

This docs site will evolve alongside the product. For now, it serves as a **living overview of OrbitCurve, our platform, and where we’re headed**.
