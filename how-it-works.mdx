## How OrbitCurve works

OrbitCurve provides **security‑focused datasets and workflows** that plug directly into your AI stack.
At a high level, there are three pillars:

1. **Data collection & curation**  
   - We aggregate and synthesize security‑relevant data from a variety of sources.  
   - We normalize, de‑duplicate, and structure it for **LLM training, fine‑tuning, and evaluation**.

2. **Labeling & evaluation design**  
   - We work with security researchers to define labels, tasks, and benchmarks that reflect real attacker/defender behavior.  
   - This becomes the foundation for **post‑training, red‑teaming, and model evaluation**.

3. **Delivery & integration**  
   - Datasets and benchmarks are exposed via **APIs, file exports, and (eventually) a hosted platform UI**.  
   - Your ML team can plug OrbitCurve data into existing training pipelines, or use it to stress‑test models before deployment.

## Typical workflow

- Identify the security use cases you care about (e.g. detection, abuse‑resistance, offensive capabilities).  
- Select the relevant OrbitCurve datasets and benchmarks.  
- Integrate them into your training/evaluation loop.  
- Iterate with us on coverage, gaps, and new scenarios as your models and threat models evolve.

As the product matures, this page will include concrete integration examples, API references, and environment‑specific guides.
