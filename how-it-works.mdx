## How OrbitCurve works

1. Work with us to develop a strategy, or bring your own, and together we will identify exactly where your model, and agent needs improvement.
2. Once the scope is defined, we begin working with our world class security engineering talent pool through our gamified platform. Our contributors are motivated by well designed incentives to deliver outstanding results.
3. At this stage, we apply a multi layered approach to data quality. Our years of experience in cybersecurity have taught us what true quality looks like, and we bring that expertise to every project.
4. This is the stage where we deliver the data, complete with benchmarks and full visibility into what has been built, how it performs, and its role in your workflow. But this is not the end. We continue working with you until you are fully satisfied with the dataset.

As the product matures, this page will include concrete integration examples, API references, and environment‑specific guides.
